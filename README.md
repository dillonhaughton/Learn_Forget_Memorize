# <center>Learn-Forget-Memorize</center>
<p>An application I developed during my first year of medical school. I noticed already built applications required monthly payments to insert photos. So this project started as a flashcards app that allowed photos freely. I evolved to incorporate machine learning to help aid in sorting the material for study. It ultimately helped me to get into the top 10% of my medical school class.</p><br>

<p>If you would like an already built application (using pyinstaller) send me a request and I can send you a link to a google drive for download</p><br>
